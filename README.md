# SMChelpR - Help functions in R for the Data Reports of the SMC. 

The Science Media Center's [Data Reports](https://www.sciencemediacenter.de/alle-angebote/suchergebnis/?tx_solr%5Bfilter%5D%5B1%5D=type%3AData+Report) are produced as a Quarto document containing code as well as all text. For the projects written in R, key functions have been bundled into this R package. 

The package primarily contains two types of functions:

- Functions to retrieve the [data API](https://github.com/sciencemediacenter/DataCollection) of the SMC.
- Functions to create the graphics included in the report.

The package can be easily installed using `devtools`:

`devtools::install_github("sciencemediacenter/SMChelpR")`
